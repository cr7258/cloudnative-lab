# Introduction

[Flagger](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger) is a progressive delivery tool that automates the release
process for applications running on Kubernetes. It reduces the risk of introducing a new software
version in production by gradually shifting traffic to the new version while measuring metrics
and running conformance tests.

Flagger implements several deployment strategies (Canary releases, A/B testing, Blue/Green mirroring)
using a service mesh (App Mesh, Istio, Linkerd)
or an ingress controller (Contour, Gloo, NGINX, Skipper, Traefik) for traffic routing.
For release analysis, Flagger can query Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch or Graphite
and for alerting it uses Slack, MS Teams, Discord and Rocket.

Flagger can be configured with Kubernetes custom resources and is compatible with
any CI/CD solutions made for Kubernetes. Since Flagger is declarative and reacts to Kubernetes events,
it can be used in **GitOps** pipelines together with tools like Flux, JenkinsX, Carvel, Argo, etc.

Flagger is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) project
and part of [Flux](https://fluxcd.io) family of GitOps tools.

## Getting started

To get started with Flagger, choose one of the supported routing providers and
[install](install/flagger-install-on-kubernetes.md) Flagger with Helm or Kustomize.
